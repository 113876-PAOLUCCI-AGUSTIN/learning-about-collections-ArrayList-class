/* IMPORTANT: An ArrayList STORES OBJECTS >>>> STRING, INTEGER, CHARACTER, ETC ETC!!!!!!!!!!!!
 *
 * The ArrayList class is a resizable array, which can be found in the java.util package.
 * The difference between a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java, is that the size of
 * an array cannot be modified (if you want to add or remove elements to/from an array,
 * you have to create a new one).
 * While elements can be added and removed from an ArrayList whenever you want.
 * The syntax is also slightly different.
 * Elements in an ArrayList are actually objects. In the examples above, we created elements
 * (objects) of type "String". Remember that a String in Java is an object (not a primitive
 * type).
